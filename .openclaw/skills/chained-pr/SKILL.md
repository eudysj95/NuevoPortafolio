## Activation Contract

Load this skill when a planned PR may exceed **400 changed lines**, SDD forecasts `400-line budget risk: High` or `Chained PRs recommended: Yes`, or the user asks for chained/stacked PRs, review slices, or reviewer-load control.

## Hard Rules

- Split PRs over **400 changed lines** unless a maintainer explicitly accepts `size:exception`.
- Keep each PR reviewable in about **≤60 minutes**.
- Use one deliverable work unit per PR; keep tests/docs with the unit they verify.
- State start, end, prior dependencies, follow-up work, and out-of-scope items in every chained PR.
- Every child PR must include a dependency diagram marking the current PR with `📍`.
- In Feature Branch Chain, create a draft/no-merge tracker PR; child PR #1 targets the tracker branch, later children target the immediate parent branch.
- Treat polluted diffs as base bugs: retarget or rebase until only the current work unit appears.
- Do not mix chain strategies after the user chooses one.

## Decision Gates

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| PR ≤400 changed lines and focused | Keep single PR. |
| PR >400, each slice can land independently | Use Stacked PRs to main. |
| PR >400, feature must integrate before main | Use Feature Branch Chain with tracker. |
| Generated/vendor/migration diff cannot split cleanly | Ask maintainer for `size:exception`. |
| SDD provides `delivery_strategy` | Follow it before apply/PR creation. |

## Execution Steps

1. Estimate changed lines and identify independent work units.
2. Ask for a chain strategy when none is cached and the budget is exceeded.
3. Create branches/PRs using the chosen strategy only.
4. Add Chain Context to each PR without replacing the repo PR template.
5. Verify each PR independently: CI/tests/docs/manual checks, rollback scope, and clean diff.
6. Keep tracker PR draft/no-merge until all child PRs are reviewed and integrated.

## Output Contract

Return the chosen strategy, PR order, current PR boundary, dependency diagram, review budget (`additions + deletions`), verification plan, and any `size:exception` rationale.
