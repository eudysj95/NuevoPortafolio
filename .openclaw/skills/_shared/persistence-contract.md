# Persistence Contract (shared across all SDD skills)

## Mode Resolution

The orchestrator passes `artifact_store.mode` with one of: `engram | openspec | hybrid | none`.

The orchestrator ASKs the user which mode they want when `/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, or `/sdd-continue` is invoked for the first time in a session. The choice is cached for the session.

Default (if user doesn't specify): if Engram is available → `engram`. Otherwise → `none`.

## Mode Roles

- **`engram`**: Working memory between sessions. Upserts overwrite — no iteration history. Local only, not shareable.
- **`openspec`**: Source of truth. Files in repo, git history, team-shareable, full audit trail.
- **`hybrid`**: Both — files for team + engram for recovery. Higher token cost.
- **`none`**: Ephemeral. Lost when conversation ends.

### Mode Comparison

| Capability | `engram` | `openspec` | `hybrid` | `none` |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Cross-session recovery | ✅ | ❌ (needs git) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Compaction survival | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Shareable with team | ❌ (local DB) | ✅ (committed files) | ✅ (files) | ❌ |
| Full iteration history | ❌ (upsert overwrites) | ✅ (git history) | ✅ (files + git) | ❌ |
| Audit trail (archive) | Partial (report only) | ✅ (full folder) | ✅ (both) | ❌ |
| Project files created | Never | Yes | Yes | Never |

### `engram` mode limitation

Engram uses `topic_key`-based upserts. Re-running a phase for the same change **overwrites** the previous version — no revision history is kept. The archive phase saves a summary report, not the full artifact folder. For iteration history or team collaboration, use `openspec` or `hybrid`.

## Behavior Per Mode

| Mode | Read from | Write to | Project files |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| `engram` | Engram | Engram | Never |
| `openspec` | Filesystem | Filesystem | Yes |
| `hybrid` | Engram (primary) + Filesystem (fallback) | Both | Yes |
| `none` | Orchestrator prompt context | Nowhere | Never |

### Hybrid Mode

Persists every artifact to BOTH Engram and OpenSpec simultaneously:
- Engram: cross-session recovery, compaction survival, deterministic search
- OpenSpec: human-readable files, version-controllable artifacts

Write to Engram (per `engram-convention.md`) AND to filesystem (per `openspec-convention.md`) for every artifact.

Read priority: Engram first; fall back to filesystem if Engram returns no results.
Write behavior: both writes MUST succeed for the operation to be complete.
Token cost warning: hybrid consumes MORE tokens per operation. Use only when you need both cross-session persistence AND local file artifacts.

## State Persistence (Orchestrator)

The orchestrator persists DAG state after each phase transition to enable SDD recovery after compaction.

| Mode | Persist State | Recover State |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| `engram` | `mem_save(topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/state", capture_prompt: false*)` | `mem_search("sdd/*/state")` → `mem_get_observation(id)` |
| `openspec` | Write `openspec/changes/{change-name}/state.yaml` | Read `openspec/changes/{change-name}/state.yaml` |
| `hybrid` | Both: `mem_save` AND write `state.yaml` | Engram first; filesystem fallback |
| `none` | Not possible — warn user | Not possible |

*For state automated artifacts, set `capture_prompt: false` when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

## Common Rules

- `none` → do NOT create or modify any project files; return results inline only
- `engram` → do NOT write any project files; persist to Engram and return observation IDs
- `openspec` → write files ONLY to paths defined in `openspec-convention.md`
- `hybrid` → persist to BOTH Engram AND filesystem; follow both conventions
- NEVER force `openspec/` creation unless orchestrator explicitly passed `openspec` or `hybrid`
- If unsure which mode to use, default to `none`

## Sub-Agent Context Rules

Sub-agents launch with a fresh context and NO access to the orchestrator's instructions or memory protocol.

Who reads, who writes:
- Non-SDD (general task): orchestrator searches engram, passes summary in prompt; sub-agent saves discoveries via `mem_save`
- SDD (phase with dependencies): sub-agent reads artifacts directly from backend; sub-agent saves its artifact
- SDD (phase without dependencies, e.g. explore): nobody reads; sub-agent saves its artifact

Why this split:
- Orchestrator reads for non-SDD: it knows what context is relevant; sub-agents doing their own searches waste tokens on irrelevant results
- Sub-agents read for SDD: SDD artifacts are large; inlining them in the orchestrator prompt would consume the entire context window
- Sub-agents always write: they have the complete detail on what happened; nuance is lost by the time results flow back to the orchestrator

## Orchestrator Prompt Instructions for Sub-Agents

Non-SDD:
```
PERSISTENCE (MANDATORY):
If you make important discoveries, decisions, or fix bugs, you MUST save them to engram before returning:
  mem_save(title: "{short description}", type: "{decision|bugfix|discovery|pattern}",
           project: "{project}", content: "{What, Why, Where, Learned}")
Do NOT return without saving what you learned. This is how the team builds persistent knowledge across sessions.
```

SDD (with dependencies):
```
Artifact store mode: {engram|openspec|hybrid|none}
Read these artifacts before starting (search returns truncated previews):
  mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/{type}", project: "{project}") → get ID
  mem_get_observation(id: {id}) → full content (REQUIRED)

PERSISTENCE (MANDATORY — do NOT skip):
After completing your work, you MUST call:
  mem_save(
    title: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
    topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
    type: "architecture",
    project: "{project}",
    capture_prompt: false,
    content: "{your full artifact markdown}"
  )
If you return without calling mem_save, the next phase CANNOT find your artifact and the pipeline BREAKS.
```

SDD (no dependencies):
```
Artifact store mode: {engram|openspec|hybrid|none}

PERSISTENCE (MANDATORY — do NOT skip):
After completing your work, you MUST call:
  mem_save(
    title: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
    topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
    type: "architecture",
    project: "{project}",
    capture_prompt: false,
    content: "{your full artifact markdown}"
  )
If you return without calling mem_save, the next phase CANNOT find your artifact and the pipeline BREAKS.
```

For SDD artifacts, `capture_prompt: false` is explicit and mandatory when the Engram tool schema supports it. Engram v1.15.3 defaults `capture_prompt` to true for normal human/proactive saves, but automated pipeline artifacts must not capture the user's prompt. Do not infer this from `type` because SDD artifacts and real human architecture decisions both use `architecture`. If an older schema rejects or does not expose `capture_prompt`, omit it rather than failing.

## Sub-Agent Response Ordering

When a sub-agent persists artifacts (via `mem_save` or file writes), the persistence call MUST happen BEFORE the final text response. The sub-agent's absolute last output must be text, never a tool call.

**Why**: The Task tool returns the sub-agent's final output to the parent. If the sub-agent ends with a tool call, the parent receives only the tool result (e.g., `"Observation saved"`) — the sub-agent's text analysis is lost. Always: do your work → save → respond with text envelope.

Sub-agents must NOT call `mem_session_summary` — that's reserved for top-level agents only.

## Skill Registry

The orchestrator pre-resolves skill paths from the skill registry and injects them as `## Skills to load before work` in your launch prompt. Sub-agents read those exact `SKILL.md` files before task-specific work.

To generate/update: run the `skill-registry` skill, or run `sdd-init`.

Sub-agent skill loading: check for a `## Skills to load before work` block in your prompt — if present, read those exact files. If not present, check for `SKILL: Load` instructions as a fallback. If neither exists, proceed without — this is not an error.

## Detail Level

The orchestrator may pass `detail_level`: `concise | standard | deep`. This controls output verbosity but does NOT affect what gets persisted — always persist the full artifact.
